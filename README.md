##Abstract

GO for Goal (**GOG**) is an interactive path remembering game, where a player has to remember a path in 2-D maze. The 2D maze is then transformed to a 3D maze where the player has to now find the target which was shown in the 2D maze.

**openGL** will be used for graphics rendering. We'll be using Java along with the [LWJGL] library.

**GOG** targets the short term memory power and helps to increase the memory over time.

##Game Arena


In the first view the player is shown the **Goal** to reach. Here the player is required to remember the path from the initial position to the Goal.

Next the 3D view is shown to the player from the initial position. Now the player has to navigate to the goal shown in the previous view in the shortest time possible.

If the player reaches the right place then its a win

Or else if the player reaches a place too far from the actual Goal then the player has to try again
